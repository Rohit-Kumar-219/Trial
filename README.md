   Shristi 2020

## Abstract
   
   The aim of the project is to create hand bot which can replicate the movements of hands of the person who is interacting with the bot, with the help of image processing. This project is a combination of live motion detection and gesture identification.
   

## Motivation 
   
   This hand gesture recognition bot is
